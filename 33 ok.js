/*
Write a program to take a number from the user and then determine if that number is a 
special type of number called a 'perfect number'.
A perfect number is a number where the sum of all its
 factors (excluding the number itself) is equal to the number itself. 
 Print Yes if the number is a perfect number else print No.

Test Case1:
Input:
6
Output:
Yes
Explanation:
The program takes the number 6 as input. It then calculates the factors of 6, 
which are 1, 2, and 3. The sum of these factors (1 + 2 + 3) is equal to 6, so 6 is a 
perfect number.

Test Case2:
Input:
12
Output:
No
Explanation:
The program takes the number 12 as input. It calculates the factors
 of 12, which are 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6. The sum of these factors (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6)
is equal to 16, which is not equal to 12. Therefore, 12 is not a perfect number.
